This is a sample document for testing the Modular RAG MCP Server.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test text splitting functionality.

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline processes documents like this one,
splitting them into chunks, generating embeddings, and storing them in a vector database.

When a user asks a question, the system retrieves relevant chunks and uses them
to generate accurate, grounded responses.
